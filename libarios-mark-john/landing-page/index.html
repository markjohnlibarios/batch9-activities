                            <b>KooperatiBank</b> Corporation is one of the Philippines’ leading universal banks serving retail, commercial, corporate and institutional clients. Established on June 18, 1951, it was the first private and Filipino-controlled bank of the post-World War II period.

                            Kooperatibank was publicly-listed with the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE: SECB) in 1995. Over the years, the Bank prudently managed to remain one of the most stable in the banking industry and is steadfast in its commitment to serve its clients and stakeholders.
                            
                            Kooperatibank’s major businesses include retail, commercial and corporate banking, and financial markets. It offers a wide range of services including financing, leasing, foreign exchange, stock brokerage, investment banking and asset management through its subsidiaries (as of December 31, 2017): KBP Cards Corporation, KBP Capital Investment Corporation, KBP Equities, Inc., KBP Forex, Inc., KBP Rental Corporation, and KBPM Leasing, Inc., a joint venture with Marubeni Corporation of Japan, and KBP Finance Company, Inc. (formerly Kooperatibank Savings).

                            In February 2015, the bank launched the Bancassurance product in partnership with FWD Life, adding to the robustness of its financial services offering.
                
                            The Bank has established a nationwide presence in the Philippines. Through its aggressive expansion efforts, the Bank is steadily growing its branch and ATM network in strategic locations in the country.
                            
                            In 2014, Kooperatibank embarked on a rebranding campaign to further strengthen market appreciation of its retail banking business, which complements its wholesale banking business. At the heart of this goal is to provide priority service and superior customer experience that resonates with a new brand promise, “BetterBanking begins here”.

                            Key Milestone in 2016: Strategic Partnership with MUFG
        
                            On January 14, 2016, Kooperatibank entered into a strategic partnership with MUFG Bank. The partnership with Japan’s largest bank provided Kooperatibank with additional capital, long-term funding and business collaboration opportunities that support the acceleration of the Bank’s long-term growth strategy including expansion of branch network and increasing penetration of the retail market.
                            
                            The strategic partnership was completed on April 1, 2016 with Kooperatibank receiving a capital investment of Php 36.9 billion from MUFG, representing MUFG’s 20% ownership of the voting stock in Kooperatibank. MUFG became the second largest shareholder of Kooperatibank with two Board seats. The Dy Group remains as the biggest shareholder of SECB with majority voting control. The capital investment by MUFG is the largest equity investment in a Philippine financial institution by a foreign investor. Kooperatibank’s shareholders’ capital increased to Php 90.2 billion pro-forma as of April 1, 2016 from Php 53.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, placing Kooperatibank among the five largest private domestic universal banks in the country by capital.
